<p><b>The public PyPI mirrors using *.pypi.python.org DNS aliases have been
    deprecated as specified in
    <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0449/">PEP 449 (Removal of
    the PyPI Mirror Auto Discovery and Naming Scheme)</a>. Package
    files uploaded to PyPI are now served through a CDN which is more reliable.
    You are welcome to continue to run your own private mirrors, but the DNS
    aliases for the mirror network ([a..z].pypi.python.org) were shut down on
    February 15th, 2014.</b></p>

<p>If you'd like to use a mirror, resources like
   <a href="http://www.pypi-mirrors.org/">http://www.pypi-mirrors.org/</a>
   are available to find public mirrors of PyPI.</p>

<p><b>Additionally, the "mirror authenticity" API specified in the PEP below
will be deprecated in the near future, and use of it is discouraged.</b></p>

<p>Use the <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/bandersnatch">bandersnatch</a>
mirroring client to set up your own mirror.</p>

 <p>The mirroring protocol is defined in <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0381">http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0381</a></p>
